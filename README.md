The schematic for the board can be found [here][1].

## Getting Started 

Please read the [Getting Started with Humble iCE][2] guide to get started 
with your board.

## Architecture 

The RP2040 serves as the bitstream uploader and communication bridge for iCE40. 
4 extra GPIO lines connect the two chips. In the default RP firmware, it exposes two CDC 
USB ports when plugged in. One is used to send the bitstream from your computer 
using a Pythion script. The second port can be used to communicate with a UART 
module in FPGA fabric. RP receives the bistream and uploads it via SPI to the 
FPGA. To save costs, we're using SPI slave mode configuration for this board. 
The bitstream is saved in the flash. When the RP boots up, if it finds a 
bistream in the flash, it will upload it to iCE40 via SPI.

Another cost saving measure used in the board: the XTAL on RP2040 is used 
to supply the clock for the iCE40 using *clk_gpout*.

There are more possibilities here - for instance, with custom RP firmware, you 
can use the iCE40 as a compute accelerator and transfer data back and forth 
via SPI using the 4 lines.

## Acknowledgment 

I'd like to thank [Sivaprash S][3] for his help with PCB design and assembly. I 
would also like to thank [Venkat Rangan][4] for reviewing the schematic, and 
for many helpful discussions.
